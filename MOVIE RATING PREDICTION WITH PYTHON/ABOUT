IMPORT LIBRARIES: 
Import all necessary libraries including pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

LOAD DATA: 
Load the movie dataset from a CSV file.

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYTICS:
Display the first few rows of the dataset.
Get basic information about the dataset.
Display summary statistics.
Check for missing values.
Visualize the distribution of movie ratings.
Visualize the distribution of other numerical features like duration.
Visualize the count of movies by genre, director, and actors.
Display the number of missing values per column.
Visualize missing values.

DATA PREPROCESSING:
Fill missing rating values with the median rating.
Convert duration and other numerical features to appropriate formats.
Handle missing values in categorical columns by filling or encoding.
Encode categorical variables like genre, director, and actors.
Prepare features and target variable for modeling.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Ensure no remaining missing values in the split data.

BUILDING AND TRAINING MODEL:
Train the Linear Regression model.
Optionally, train other regression models like Decision Trees or Support Vector Machines.

EVALUATING MODEL:
Make predictions and calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared for the model.
Perform cross-validation to assess the model's robustness.

ADDITIONAL VISUALIZATIONS:
Visualize the correlation matrix of features.
Plot true ratings versus predicted ratings to evaluate model performance.
