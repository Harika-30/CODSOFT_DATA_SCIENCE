IMPORT LIBRARIES: 
Import all necessary libraries including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

LOAD DATA: 
Load the sales dataset from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYTICS:
•	Display the first few rows of the dataset.
•	Get basic information about the dataset.
•	Display summary statistics of numerical features.
•	Check for missing values in each column.
•	Visualize the distribution of sales values using a histogram.
•	Visualize the distribution of numerical features with boxplots.
•	Visualize the correlation matrix of numerical features.
•	Plot pairwise relationships between numerical features.
•	If a 'Date' column exists, visualize sales trends over time.
•	If a 'Category' column exists, visualize the distribution of sales by category.
•	Display the number of missing values per column after visualization.
•	Visualize missing values using a heatmap.

DATA PREPROCESSING:
•	Fill missing sales values with the median of the sales column.
•	Drop rows with missing values in other columns.
•	Verify no remaining missing values are present after preprocessing.
•	Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
•	Prepare features (X) and the target variable (y).
•	Standardize features using StandardScaler.
•	Split the data into training and testing sets.
•	Ensure no remaining missing values in the split data.

BUILDING AND TRAINING MODEL:
•	Train a Linear Regression model on the training data.
•	Fit the model and make predictions on the test data.

EVALUATING MODEL:
•	Calculate performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
•	Assess model accuracy with R-squared.
•	Optionally, perform cross-validation to ensure robustness.

SAVE AND LOAD MODEL:
•	Save the trained model using joblib.
•	Load the saved model for future use.

ADDITIONAL VISUALIZATIONS:
•	Plot predicted sales versus actual sales.
•	Visualize feature importance using model coefficients.
