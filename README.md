## TASK-1: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
The Titanic Survival Prediction project is a well-known beginner's exercise in machine learning. It involves using data about passengers, such as age, gender, and ticket class, to predict whether they survived the Titanic disaster. The process includes exploring and cleaning the data, handling missing values, and converting categorical data into numerical format. Different machine learning models, like K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), are then trained on the data. The models are evaluated to determine which one best predicts survival. This project helps to understand data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
